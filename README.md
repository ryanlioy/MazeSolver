# Maze Solver

Takes an image of a maze and outputs an image of the maze with a highlighted solution path.

# Solving

Uses the [A* pathfinding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to solve the puzzle.

# Input

Input image must

- be a black and white image.
- have walls that are black and paths that are white.
- start in the top row and finish in the bottom row (although I might change that)

# How to run
Best when running from an IDE. I wrote this in Intellij but VS code should work 
fine too. Just change the path in `Main` on line 7
