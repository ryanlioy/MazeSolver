# Solution times

Tiny, small, and normal are solved in less than a second.

combo400 took less than 15 seconds (usually around 13-14 seconds). combo6k

perfect2k ran for an hour and then I gave up. I'm not even going to bother trying perfect4k, perfect10k, and perfect15k. These only have one solution.

Braid200 took around 1.4 seconds.

100x100 is solved in around 1.7 seconds.

250x250 is solved in around 6.7 seconds.

500x500 took a half hour and then I gave up.
